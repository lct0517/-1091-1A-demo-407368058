      <h2>	Who Can Win America’s Politics of Humiliation?／Thomas L. Friedman</h2>

      <p class="quote">
        About four years ago, without asking anybody, I changed my job description.
         It used to be “New York Times foreign affairs columnist.” Instead, I 
         started calling myself the “New York Times humiliation and dignity 
         columnist.”
          I even included it on my business card.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        It had become so obvious to me that so much of what I’d been doing since I 
        became a journalist in 1978 was reporting or opining about people, leaders,
         refugees, terrorists and nation-states acting out on their feelings of 
         humiliation and questing for dignity — the two most powerful human emotions.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        I raise this now because the success of Joe Biden’s campaign against Donald 
        Trump may ride on his ability to speak to the sense of humiliation and quest 
        for dignity of many Trump supporters, which Hillary Clinton failed to do.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        It has been obvious ever since Trump first ran for president that many of his 
        core supporters actually hate the people who hate Trump, more than they care 
        about Trump or any particular action he takes, no matter how awful.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">

        The media feed Trump’s supporters a daily diet of how outrageous this or that 
        Trump action is — but none of it diminishes their support. Because many Trump 
        supporters are not attracted to his policies. They’re attracted to his attitude 
        — his willingness and evident delight in skewering the people they hate and who 
        they feel look down on them.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        Humiliation, in my view, is the most underestimated force in politics and 
        international relations. The poverty of dignity explains so much more behavior 
        than the poverty of money.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        People will absorb hardship, hunger and pain. They will be grateful for jobs, cars
         and benefits. But if you make people feel humiliated, they will respond with a 
         ferocity unlike any other emotion, or just refuse to lift a finger for you. As 
         Nelson Mandela once observed, “There is nobody more dangerous than one who has 
         been humiliated.”
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
      By contrast, if you show people respect, if you affirm their dignity, it is amazing 
      what they will let you say to them or ask of them. Sometimes it just takes listening 
      to them, but deep listening — not just waiting for them to stop talking. Because 
      listening is the ultimate sign of respect. What you say when you listen speaks more 
      than any words.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        When it comes to politics, a lot of people don’t listen through their ears. They 
        listen through their gut, and Biden, more than any other Democratic leader today, 
        has the ability to connect there.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        Trump’s goal in this campaign is to separate Biden from Biden voters by making it
         as difficult as possible for Biden voters to vote. Biden’s goal should be to 
         separate Trump from Trump voters by showing that he respects them and their fears 
         — even if he does not respect Trump.
      </p>

      <h2>As Traffic Signals Change, Some See a Token Gesture ／Tiffany May</h2>

      <p class="quote">
        As Traffic Signals Change, Some See a Token Gesture
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        At one of the most prominent street crossings in Mumbai, the little people in the 
        signal lights have swapped their straight-legged trousers for triangular frocks.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        The city, India’s largest, last month installed 240 pedestrian signals that replaced
         male stick figures with female silhouettes along a stretch of road in the Dadar 
         neighborhood. Mumbai is the first city in the country to install such signals, and 
         officials say the initiative represents a commitment to empower women.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        The government “is ensuring gender equality with a simple idea — the signals now have
         women, too,” wrote Aaditya Thackeray, the tourism and environment minister for 
         Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        But critics called the move a superficial token that would do little to fix entrenched 
        issues of gender inequality in India. While women have occupied powerful positions in 
        the country — Indira Gandhi became India’s first female prime minister — instances of 
        high-profile violence against women in public have left many reluctant to leave home 
        unaccompanied after dark. And domestic abuse and sexual assault are the most common 
        crimes against women and girls, according to government statistics.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        Women in India also face obstacles in education and employment. For every 100 boys in 
        the country, only 73 girls are enrolled in secondary schools, according to government 
        statistics. And women work fewer paid hours than men, bearing the brunt of unpaid 
        domestic labor.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        “It’s a gesture, but a tacky one,” said Pooja Sastry, a 32-year-old urban planner from
         Bangalore. “Those stick figures don’t make us feel any safer on the road.”“It means 
         nothing for the average Indian woman, or a female construction worker crossing the 
         road for her daily wage job,” she added. “The crime rate isn’t going to come down. 
         Domestic violence isn’t going to come down.”
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        A brutal gang rape on a Delhi bus in 2012 shook the country, setting off protests and 
        discussions of women’s safety in cities. It also led to stricter punishment for crimes
         against women, including the death penalty for rape.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        But sexual assault, harassment and domestic violence have remained persistent. The 
        country — which was found to be the most dangerous place for women when it comes to 
        sexual violence and harassment, according to a 2018 Thomson Reuters Foundation poll of 
        550 global experts — reported 33,356 rapes and 89,097 assaults against women that year, 
        according to government statistics.
      </p>

      <p class="post-info">
        When Thackeray tried in January to introduce more night cafes and 24-hour gyms and movie 
        theaters in Mumbai in an attempt to add vitality to city life, his political rivals from 
        the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the plan because they said it would make women more 
        vulnerable to rape.
